Data Wrangling/EDA Tasks: 

1. What is in your data? Lily

The College Scorecard 2022-2023 dataset provides detailed information on higher education institutions across the United States. When we downloaded the data from the US Department of Education, the file was too large to upload to Github so we chose specific variables of interest and combined them into a dataset to use for this project. It includes data on institutional information, student aid, enrollment, cost, and student outcomes. By offering insights into these factors, the dataset helps assess the accessibility, affordability, and effectiveness of universities. This dataset is a valuable resource for analyzing patterns in higher education, allowing us to investigate factors that influence student success and performance.
